This is a space themed shoot em style game that I made in early 2014.

Its made entirely with HTML, CSS, and javascript using the HTML5 Canvas element. It features a lot of images (good use of sprite sheets to make animated explosions), sounds, as well as requestAnimationFrame for a rendering loop. Rather than deal with the terrible HTML5 audio API, I used Howler for audio.

Let too many enemies escape or get hit too many times and you'll lose. Kill 200 and you'll fight a boss! Its pretty simple!

The code is really messy, but it just goes to show how far I've come in such a short time!
